%\section{Processor}

%The whole processor is pulled together in two encapsulating modules. 
%The datapath module links the registers and ALU and implements the data multiplexors, program counter and accumulator.
%The top level CPU module links the program ROM, controller and datapath. 

\section{Datapath}
\subsection{Testbench}
\todo[inline]{Explain testbench}
The testbench conducts the following tests:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Program counter increment and write enable
\item Immidate loading into accumulator
\item Addition with an immediate
\item Write back to register
\item Read from register
\item Store switches to registers
\item Read switches from register
\item Program counter jump to accumulator value
\end{enumerate}

These operations are verified by viewing the LED output (the accumulator) and the program counter.
Assertions are used to check the outputs and keep an error count. 
This testbench is to check the internal connections of the datapath, and also the implementation of the extra registers.
Figure \ref{fig:datapathsim} shows the waveform of the simulation. 
The error count remains zero through out showing no errors exist in the datapath.

\section{CPU}
\subsection{Testbench}
\todo[inline]{Describe testbench}

The testbench has two main parts; a task to commence the handshaking protocols, and a function to calculated the expected result. 
The handshaking task also contains assertions to verify the output. 
The function contains the constants and calculates the transform, with correct rounding.
This can be seen in listing \ref{lstcpufunction}.
