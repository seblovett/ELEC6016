\section{Conclusion}

%\todo[inline]{Which objectives in intro have been done. }
The final processor satisfies the specification and the objectives highlighted in section \ref{sect:intro}.
The processor is a register-accumulator based, MIPS-esk \todo{is this an appropriate term?!} architecture. 
It implements ten instructions in total to calculate the affine transform of 8 bit data.

%\todo[inline]{Cost figure}
The total cost of the processor is 72.
A full breakdown of the costs is seen in table \ref{tab:costs}.
A large amount of the cost is located in the datapath. 
This is due to the multiplexors needed to direct the data around. 
A more compact design could be achieved by aiming to minimize these elements. 
The two registers in the datapath also contribute a fair amount to the cost. 
These are a compromise and by using a register-register architecture, the decoding logic is increased and a larger instruction is needed.
Overall, the design is a success, passing thorough testing and achieves the initial goals.
