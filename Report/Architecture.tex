\section{Architecture}

Discuss the overall architecture

A register-accumulator based architecture was decided to be used. 
This results in the instruction only needing one operand, reducing the overall size. 
Figure \ref{fig:arch} shows the architecture of the processor, excluding the control and control signals.

Each aspect of the processor are discussed in the following sections, looking at the design, test and synthesis of the modules.
